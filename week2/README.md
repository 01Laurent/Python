        *Data Structures And ALgorithims.
    - Built in structures
        - List
        - Tuple
        - Dictionary
        - Set
    - User defined structures
        - Stack
        - Queue
        - Tree
        - Linked list
        - Graph
        - Hashmap

Mutability - refers to data inside the datastructure that can be modified.

    *Lists and Tuples
- A list stores multiple data at a time.
    students_age = [23, 34, 34, 56, 12]
- A list can have different data types.
    students_age = [23, 34, 34, 56, 12, 30.5, "Yazmin"]
- When a list is sliced the start index is inclusive but the end index is exclusiive.

    *Tuples
- Tuples are paranthesis optional.
    my_tuple = 2, 3, 4, 5
    my_tuple = (2, 3, 4, 5)


    *Stack 
- A linear data structure following the first in first out(FIFO) principle.
    -push(add), pop(remove), peek(view top element)
